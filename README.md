Agility is an MVC library for browser-side Javascript that lets you write **maintainable** code without compromising on **development speed**. It's [write less, do more](http://www.jquery.com) with maintainability. 

Features include:

+ Painless two-way model-view bindings;
+ Implicit controller-event bindings;
+ Controller auto-proxying for quick and consistent access to owner object;
+ Format and style in-object for "copy-and-paste" reusability;
+ Small (<10K) single-library include;
+ Compact and efficient syntax, inspired by jQuery;
+ Pure prototypal inheritance;
+ Strict MVC: core has no additional concepts other than M, V, and C.
