# Agility.js - Unit tests

To test core components _without_ persistence (which requires Node.js), point your browser to:
  
    public/core_only.html

To run the full test including persistence you will need `node` and `npm`. From the command line:

    npm install
    node server.js

Then point your browser to:

    http://localhost:8222/
